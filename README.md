# Photo Portfolio

I wanted a plain and simple web for uploading my photos, publishing it via GitHub pages. Pure HTML/CSS, no JS, no libraries.

It uses a kind-of masonry layout, with two columns on desktop and a single column on mobile:

<img width="2449" height="2328" alt="photo_portfolio_desktop" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c1623a8-79d1-46a7-9649-382a0aea4ca5" />

<img width="384" height="760" alt="photo_portfolio_mobile" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec09c977-5afa-4039-aa13-cc9d6a47eac3" />

Since I didn't want to manually add new images to my HTML, I prepared this simple repo and coded a (dirty but functional) script that compresses and uploads new images to the portfolio, also pushing the changes to GitHub. That script can be found [**in this other repo**](https://github.com/laureanorp/photo_uploader_script)

So, I use that script to update my photo portfolio automatically, which is published thanks to GitHub Pages

## Usage

1. This an static website, there's nothing to use :) just clone the repo and modify it as you wish

If you are looking on how to use this template along with the automatic script I mentioned, the instructiosn can be found [**here**](https://github.com/laureanorp/photo_uploader_script)
